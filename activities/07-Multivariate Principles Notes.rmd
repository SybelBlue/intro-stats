# Multivariate Modeling Principles

\


**Where are we?!**    
- You've seen *most* of the RStudio syntax we'll need in this course. You'll continue to apply and familiarize yourself with this code.
- We're talking about multivariate relationships: modeling y by multiple predictors x! Why? If 2 or more predictors x both tell us about y, then maybe both together can tell us even more!
- You'll explore the main ideas today. The video for tomorrow will *review* these ideas and then you'll explore these same ideas more deeply on Tuesday and Wednesday.


\


**Goals**

- **Multivariate statistical models** can enhance our understanding and predictions of a response variable $y$ by including *more than one predictor variable*. [You can find the preparatory slides for this topic here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zBr71v1XqfmQpah1Go22ZMT8sApTcxRS/view?usp=sharing)
- In this activity, we'll explore multivariate visualizations and models.  In doing so, recall that it's important to focus on the *guiding principles* (good for long-term retention, deeper understanding, and ability to generalize) as opposed memorizing "rules" (which don't exist!).
- Practice *interpreting* multivariate models.

## Getting started

Load some data:

```{r}
# Load packages & import data
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
bikes <- read.csv("https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/155/bike_share.csv")
```


Take a quick peak at the results for four bivariate models of ridership, which will be referenced throughout the activity:

```{r}
# Build and summarize some bivariate models
bike_model_1 <- lm(riders_registered ~ windspeed, bikes)
summary(bike_model_1)$r.squared
bike_model_2 <- lm(riders_registered ~ temp_feel, bikes)
summary(bike_model_2)$r.squared
bike_model_3 <- lm(riders_registered ~ weekend, bikes)
summary(bike_model_3)$r.squared
bike_model_4 <- lm(riders_registered ~ season, bikes)
summary(bike_model_4)$r.squared
```


Below, you will consider three more models, each which have **two** predictors. Note the syntax now (you'll explore the output below).


```{r}
# A model with 1 categorical & 1 quantitative predictor
bike_model_5 <- lm(riders_registered ~ windspeed + weekend, bikes)
summary(bike_model_5)$r.squared

# A model with 2 categorical predictors
bike_model_6 <- lm(riders_registered ~ weekend + season, bikes)
summary(bike_model_6)$r.squared

# A model with 2 quantitative predictors
bike_model_7 <- lm(riders_registered ~ windspeed + temp_feel, bikes)
summary(bike_model_7)$r.squared
```

## Exercises


\



### Exercise 1: Hello!


\
\



### Exercise 2: 1 categorical & 1 quantitative predictor: visualization


Adjust the code below to recreate this visualization of the relationship of `riders_registered` with the quantitative `windspeed` predictor and categorical `weekend` predictor.

![](https://www.macalester.edu/~ajohns24/images/stat155/bikes_multivar_1.png)

```{r}
ggplot(bikes, aes(y = riders_registered, x = windspeed, color = weekend)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

    


\
\



### Exercise 3: 1 categorical & 1 quantitative predictor: building a model

`bike_model_5` (which you built above) *models* the multivariate trend of riders vs windspeed and weekend:
    
```{r}
summary(bike_model_5)$coefficient
```
    
a. Fill in the model formula: riders_registered = 4738.38053 - 63.97072 windspeed - 925.15701 weekendTRUE

b. Confirm that `bike_model_5` predicts roughly 3174 rides on *weekend* days when the windspeed is 10 mph and roughly 4099 rides on *weekdays* when the windspeed is 10 mph.  Make sure you can match up these predictions with what you see on the plot.
``` {r}
4738.38053 - 63.97072 * 10 - 925.15701 * 1
4738.38053 - 63.97072 * 10 - 925.15701 * 0
```



\
\


### Exercise 4: 1 categorical & 1 quantitative predictor: interpreting the model    

We saw in exercise 2 that the `bike_model_5` trend is represented by two lines: one describing the relationship between rides and windspeed on weekends and the other on weekdays. This observation is key to interpreting `bike_model_5`!    

a. Utilize the model formula from exercise 3 to identify the equations of these two lines. Hint: Plug `weekendTRUE = 0` and `weekendTRUE = 1`.   
    weekdays: riders_registered = 4098.673 - 63.97072 windspeed   
    weekends: riders_registered = 3173.516 - 63.97072 windspeed

b. Reflecting on part a, interpret the intercept coefficient (4738.38), `windspeed` coefficient (-63.97), & `weekendTRUE` coefficient (925.16). Think: To what features of the two lines do these correspond? Where are they used in part a?     

With no wind, on a weekday, there are intercept coeff ridres. Each mph of wind decreases the ridership by 63.97. Weekends have a lower ridership on the average day.


\
\




### Exercise 5: 2 categorical predictors: visualization

Adjust the code below to recreate this visualization of the relationship of `riders_registered` with the categorical `season` and `weekend` predictors. HINT: color or fill    

![](https://www.macalester.edu/~ajohns24/images/stat155/bikes_multivar_2.png)
    
```{r}
ggplot(bikes, aes(y = riders_registered, x = season, fill = weekend)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
    
   
   
   
   
   
    

\
\



### Exercise 6: 2 categorical predictors: build & interpret the model

`bike_model_6` (which you built above) *models* the multivariate trend of riders vs season and weekend:
    
```{r}
summary(bike_model_6)$coefficient
```

a. Confirm that the model formula is: `riders_registered = 4260.45 - 912.33 weekendTRUE - 116.38 seasonspring + 438.44 seasonsummer - 1719.06 seasonwinter`

b. Use this model to predict the ridership on the following days:    
    - a fall weekday     
    - a winter weekday    
    - a fall weekend day        
    - a winter weekend day
``` {r}
4260.45 - 912.33 * 0 - 116.38 * 0 + 438.44 * 0 - 1719.06 * 0
4260.45 - 912.33 * 0 - 116.38 * 0 + 438.44 * 0 - 1719.06 * 1
4260.45 - 912.33 * 1 - 116.38 * 0 + 438.44 * 0 - 1719.06 * 0
4260.45 - 912.33 * 1 - 116.38 * 0 + 438.44 * 0 - 1719.06 * 1
```
c. How many possible predictions does this model produce?
``` {r}
2*4
```
d. Use these calculations and insights to interpret the intercept coefficient, `weekendTRUE` coefficient, and `seasonwinter` coefficient.  Hint: What is the meaning and consequence of plugging in 0 for `weekendTRUE`? Plugging in 1?    

On the weekend, there are roughly 900 less riders, and in the winter there are roughly 1700 even less riders than in fall.

### Exercise 7: 2 quantitative predictors: visualization   


Adjust the code below to recreate two visualizations of the relationship of `riders_registered` with the quantitative `windspeed` and `temp_feel` predictors.
    
![](https://www.macalester.edu/~ajohns24/images/stat155/bikes_multivar_3.png)

```{r}
ggplot(bikes, aes(y = riders_registered, x = windspeed, color = temp_feel)) + 
  geom_point()
ggplot(bikes, aes(y = riders_registered, x = windspeed, size = temp_feel)) + 
  geom_point()
```
    
    

\
\




### Exercise 8: 2 quantitative predictors: modeling

`bike_model_7` (which you built above) *models* the multivariate trend of riders vs windspeed and temperature:

```{r}
summary(bike_model_7)$coefficient
```


a. Write out the model formula.

riders = -24.0646 - 36.54372 * windspeed + 55.51648 * temp_feel

b. Confirm that this model predicts roughly 2941 rides on days when the windspeed is 10 mph and the temperature is 60 degrees.    
```{r}
-24.0646 - 36.54372 * 10 + 55.51648 * 60
```


\
\



### Exercise 9: 2 quantitative predictors: interpreting the model

The `bike_model_7` model formula is the formula of a *plane* (drawn below). CHALLENGE: Interpret the coefficients that define this plane (ie. the intercept, `windspeed`, and `temp_feel` coefficients from `bike_model_3`). HINTS:    

- In the left plot, the red arrows demonstrate the model trend at three different windspeeds (5, 20, and 30 mph).  What are the slopes of these lines? 

\[55.51648\]

- In the right plot, the red arrows demonstrate the model trend at three different temperatures (40, 60, and 90 degrees).  What are the slopes of these lines?

\[-36.54372\]

### Exercise 10: Which is best?

We've now seen 7 different models of ridership. Use the following table to answer the questions below.
    
model                     predictors                R^2^
------------------------- ------------------------- ------------
`bike_model_1`            `windspeed`               0.047
`bike_model_2`            `temp_feel`               0.296
`bike_model_3`            `weekend`                 0.074
`bike_model_4`            `season`                  0.279
`bike_model_5`            `windspeed` & `weekend`   0.119
`bike_model_6`            `weekend` & `season`      0.349
`bike_model_7`            `windspeed` & `temp_feel` 0.310

a. Which model does the best job of explaining the variability in ridership from day to day? What does this tell you about ridership?

model6, riders \~ weekend + season

b. If you could only pick one predictor, which would it be?

temp_feel

c. What happens to R-squared when we add a second predictor to our model, and why does this make sense? For example, how does the R-squared for model 5 (with both windspeed and weekend) compare to those of model 1 (only windspeed) and model 3 (only weekend)?

It generally increases, which makes sense because riders choose to ride for many reasons. Model 5 has an r squared value of almost the sum of models 3 and 1.

d. Are 2 predictors always better than 1? Provide evidence and explain why this makes sense.

No, temp_feel by itself was a better match than windspeed and weekend. This makes sense because certain factors weigh more heavily than others, or even combinations of others.

### Exercise 11: Reflection: principles of interpretation

These exercises have revealed some **principles** behind interpreting model coefficients. These are summarized below. Review and confirm that these make sense.
    
    

\
\



---

**Principles of interpretation**


A linear regression model describes the **trend** of a relationship between a *response* variable ($y$) and a set of *predictors* ($x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$).  Suppose we have the following model *without* interaction terms (which we'll learn about soon):


$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p$$

Then we can interpret the coefficients as follows:    

- $\beta_0$ ("beta 0") is the y-intercept.  It describes the typical value of $y$ when $x_1, x_2,..., x_k$ are all 0, ie. when all quantitative predictors are set to 0 and the categorical predictors are set to their reference levels.    

- $\beta_i$ ("beta i") is the coefficient of $x_i$.    

    - If $x_i$ is quantitative, $\beta_i$ describes the typical change in $y$ per 1-unit increase in $x_i$ while at a fixed set of the other $x$.    
    - If $x_i$ represents a category of a categorical variable, $\beta_i$ describes the typical change in $y$ when we move to this category from the reference category while at a fixed set of the other $x$.
